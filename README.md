# fsu_purlz
Scripts for building and deploying a [PURLZ](http://www.purlz.org/) container.

# Repo Contents
- `fsu_purlz/Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for defining the container image.
- `fsu_purlz/purlz.env`: Set of environmental variables to customize build & deployment.
- `fsu_purlz/default.purlz.config`: A basic config file containing variables that will get swapped in `fsu_purlz/build.sh` to turn it into `xform.purlz.config`, which is what actually gets used.
- `fsu_purlz/build.sh`: Bash script for building a container image from the `fsu_purlz/Dockerfile`.
- `fsu_purlz/deploy.sh`: Bash script for deploying the container and mounting `fsu_purlz/purlz_data`.
- `fsu_purlz/purlz_data`: An empty directory that gets mounted to the host in `fsu_purlz/deploy.sh` so you can keep your HSQLDB data outside of the container.

# Usage
Download this repo, set your envars in `fsu_purlz/purlz.env`, run `fsu_purlz/build.sh` to create a custom container image, and then run `fsu_purlz/deploy.sh` to launch it and try it out.

# Backups
This PURLZ server is configured to use HyperSQL (HSQLDB) for data storage, and the files that HSQLDB stores data in are mounted to the host at `fsu_purlz/purlz_data` so that they can easily be backed up, with the most convenient method being to create a zip file of `fsu_purlz/purlz_data/*`. 

If you would like to restore the PURLZ server using a previously created backup, simply: 
1. Stop the container
2. Delete all of the existing files in the `fsu_purlz/purlz_data` directory
3. Place files from a previously created backup in `fsu_purlz/purlz_data`
4. Start the container again

When the container resumes, it will be using the data from the previously created backup. Note that if you replace the data in `fsu_purlz/purlz_data` without restarting the PURLZ server, it will continue to use the data from memory and slowly overwrite the replaced backup data. Stopping the PURLZ server is required to release the current data from memory, and starting the PURLZ server again is required to source the new backup data.
